# 🚗 Moonrider Indicator Control System (Wokwi + ATmega328P)

This project implements an **automotive indicator control system** using the ATmega328P microcontroller on Wokwi. The system handles **Left**, **Right**, and **Hazard** light indicators as per embedded software requirements and simulates real-world logic with GPIO, PWM, UART, and button control.

---

## 📋 Assignment Objectives

- Develop C-based base software for indicator control
- Simulate with ATmega328P on Wokwi
- Blink indicators at 300ms intervals
- Capture button press events using GPIO
- Publish system state logs via UART
- Integrate BLE control (future extension)
- Build application logic modularly for Simulink integration

## 🛠️ Hardware Simulation Setup (Wokwi)

| Component       | Pin            |
|----------------|----------------|
| Left Button     | D2             |
| Right Button    | D3             |
| Left LED        | D9 (PWM)       |
| Right LED       | D10 (PWM)      |
| UART Output     | Serial Monitor |

## 🧠 Core Features

- ⏱ **1-sec Button Hold**: Detects long-press using scheduler and state tracking
- 🔁 **300ms LED Blink**: Non-blocking blink using timer logic
- 🔄 **Mode Switching**: Switch between left/right/hazard modes seamlessly
- 🔧 **Hazard Mode**: Activated by pressing both buttons together for 1 sec
- 🔕 **Debounce Logic**: Avoids retriggering while holding
- 📤 **UART Logging**: Publishes state changes via Serial Monitor

## 🧪 How to Use (Wokwi)

1. Open simulation in Wokwi  
2. Press and hold:
   - Left Button (D2) → Toggles Left indicator
   - Right Button (D3) → Toggles Right indicator
   - Both for 1s → Activates Hazard mode
3. Observe LED behavior and Serial logs
